# Code for Accuracy of Precipitation Forecasts: Finding the Right Threshold for What is Considered Rain

For Data Expo at Joint Statistical Meeting 2018, Vancouver. Analysis, graphs and maps were all made entirely using R and RStudio. All scripts are R Markdown (rmd) files.

Authors are Darren Keeley and Eric A. Suess from CSU East Bay.


## How to Use

Code is composed of 3 rmd's. **1 prepare datasets** creates the dataframes necessary to run the analysis form the competition datasets. **2 figures and tables** uses these dataframes to create graphics, except the maps. **3 maps** creates the blue and red maps.

Create a folders **data** and **pics** in the folder where the scripts are located. Place the competition datasets in **data**; these include **histWeather.csv**, **forecast.dat**, and **locations.csv**. 

Uncomment the "save" functions in the rmd **2** and **3**. Run scripts in sequential order.
